# EngineerTeamGenerator
    this project enables a user to effectively produce a structural
    team log of everyone from interns to managers. Not only is this user friendly,
    but it produces a professional and polished looking team log. Again, the function to 
    actually write the file was the most challenging for me but luckily, with a look at 
    it with a fresh pair of eyes I could identify the problem and find a solution.
